          <p>
          Web developer pivoting not-so-far from the Art world. My existing skillset in graphic design and photography lends itself well to front-end-focused web developing; I now have the knowledge and tools to bring a product together and to-life. I enjoy creating fluid designs that are intuitive to use.
